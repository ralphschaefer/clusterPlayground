Cluster with websocket frontend
===============================

* Every cluster Node creates own webserver with websocket
* One cluster node must be started as seed Node
* All non-seed cluster nodes can send messages with cli and with websocket frontend
* after startup of any node the port on wich the webserver listens is 
  propagated in the cli
